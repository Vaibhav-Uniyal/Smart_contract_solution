### 2.2 Core Components

#### 2.2.1 Data Structures

**Trade Struct:**
The central data structure containing all trade information:
```solidity
struct Trade {
    address payable buyer;      // Payment sender
    address payable seller;     // Payment recipient  
    address verifier;           // Trusted third party
    uint256 value;              // Escrow amount (wei)
    string shipmentDetails;     // Goods description
    bytes32 documentHash;       // Document fingerprint
    bool documentVerified;      // Verification status
    State state;                // Current trade state
    uint256 createdAt;          // Creation timestamp
}
```

**State Enum:**
Finite state machine with seven possible states:
```solidity
enum State { 
    Created,      // Initial (unused)
    PaymentHeld,  // Payment in escrow
    Shipped,      // Goods in transit
    Delivered,    // Delivery confirmed
    Released,     // Payment released
    Refunded,     // Payment refunded
    Disputed      // Under dispute
}
```

    [PaymentHeld] ──────────────────────────────────────┐
           │                                            │
           │ (documents verified)                       │
           ▼                                            │
      [Shipped] ─────────────────────────────────────── │ (dispute)
           │                                            │
           │ (delivery confirmed)                       ▼
           ▼                                      [Disputed]
     [Delivered] ──────────────────────────────────────┘
           │                                            │

## 3. Code Explanation

### 3.1 Contract Initialization

```solidity
constructor() {
    // nextTradeId initialized to 1 in declaration
    // Ensures trade ID 0 reserved for validation
}
```

The constructor is intentionally minimal, with `nextTradeId` initialized to 1 at declaration. This design choice reserves trade ID 0 for validation purposes, allowing the `tradeExists` modifier to efficiently check for non-existent trades.

### 3.2 Core Function Analysis

#### 3.2.1 createTrade() - Transaction Initiation

**Purpose**: Implements Requirement 1 - Transaction Initiation

```solidity
function createTrade(
    address payable seller,
    address verifier,
    string memory shipmentDetails
) external payable returns (uint256)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Payable modifier**: Allows ETH deposit during function call
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- **Atomic operation**: Trade creation and payment deposit in single transaction
- **Event emission**: Transparent logging for off-chain monitoring

**Security Considerations:**
- Prevents buyer-seller address collision
- Validates non-zero payment amount
- Ensures valid verifier address
- Immediate state transition to PaymentHeld

**Gas Optimization:**
- Single storage operation for trade creation
- Efficient ID generation with pre-increment
- Minimal external calls

#### 3.2.2 Document Verification Flow

**submitDocuments() - Document Submission:**
```solidity
function submitDocuments(uint256 tradeId, bytes32 docHash) external 
    tradeExists(tradeId)
    onlySeller(tradeId) 
    inState(tradeId, State.PaymentHeld)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **Access control**: Only seller can submit documents
- **State validation**: Must be in PaymentHeld state
- **Hash storage**: Cryptographic document fingerprint
- **Event logging**: Transparent document submission

**verifyDocuments() - Third-Party Authentication:**
```solidity
function verifyDocuments(uint256 tradeId) external 
    tradeExists(tradeId)
    onlyVerifier(tradeId) 
    inState(tradeId, State.PaymentHeld)
```

**Security Features:**
- **Role separation**: Verifier independent from buyer/seller
- **Prerequisite checking**: Documents must be submitted first
- **Immutable verification**: Boolean flag prevents re-verification
- **Audit trail**: Event emission for transparency

#### 3.2.3 State Management Functions

**markShipped() - Shipment Initiation:**
- **Prerequisite**: Documents must be verified
- **State transition**: PaymentHeld → Shipped
- **Access control**: Seller-only operation
- **Business logic**: Prevents shipment without proper documentation

**confirmDelivery() - Automated Payment Trigger:**
```solidity
function confirmDelivery(uint256 tradeId) external 
    tradeExists(tradeId)
    onlyBuyer(tradeId) 
    inState(tradeId, State.Shipped)
{
    trades[tradeId].state = State.Delivered;
    emit DeliveryConfirmed(tradeId);
    
    // AUTOMATED PAYMENT RELEASE
    trades[tradeId].state = State.Released;
    pendingWithdrawals[trades[tradeId].seller] += trades[tradeId].value;
    emit PaymentReleased(tradeId, trades[tradeId].seller, trades[tradeId].value);
}
```

**Critical Design Elements:**
- **Automatic payment release**: Implements Requirement 4
- **Dual state transition**: Delivered → Released in single transaction
- **Withdrawal pattern**: Uses pending balances for security
- **Event emission**: Multiple events for complete audit trail

#### 3.2.4 Dispute Resolution System

**raiseDispute() - Dispute Initiation:**
- **Bilateral access**: Both buyer and seller can raise disputes
- **State restrictions**: Only in PaymentHeld or Shipped states
- **Process halt**: Prevents normal trade progression
- **Transparency**: Event emission for dispute tracking

**resolveDispute() - Third-Party Resolution:**
```solidity
function resolveDispute(
    uint256 tradeId, 
    bool refundToBuyer, 
    string memory reason
) external 
    tradeExists(tradeId)
    onlyVerifier(tradeId) 
    inState(tradeId, State.Disputed)
```

**Resolution Logic:**
- **Binary outcome**: Refund buyer or pay seller
- **Reason logging**: Human-readable resolution rationale
- **Final state**: Either Refunded or Released
- **Balance update**: Appropriate party receives funds

#### 3.2.5 Security Functions

**withdraw() - Secure Fund Withdrawal:**
```solidity
function withdraw() external {
    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
    
    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;  // Reset before transfer
    
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

**Security Mechanisms:**
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**: State changes before external calls
- **Reentrancy protection**: Balance reset prevents recursive calls
- **Low-level call**: Secure ETH transfer mechanism
- **Success validation**: Ensures transfer completion

**emergencyRefund() - Edge Case Handling:**
- **Time-based activation**: 30-day delay prevents abuse
- **Buyer protection**: Prevents indefinite fund lockup
- **State restriction**: Only in PaymentHeld state
- **Last resort mechanism**: When normal flow fails

### 3.3 View Functions and Utilities

**getTrade() - Information Retrieval:**
- **Complete data access**: Returns all trade information
- **Read-only operation**: No state changes or gas costs
- **Input validation**: Ensures trade existence
- **Structured return**: Organized data for easy consumption

**Utility Functions:**
- `getPendingWithdrawal()`: Check withdrawal balances
- `getContractBalance()`: Monitor contract ETH holdings
- `generateDocumentHash()`: Create cryptographic document fingerprints

## 5. Security Analysis

### 5.1 Security Architecture Overview

The TradeEscrow contract implements multiple layers of security following industry best practices and addressing common smart contract vulnerabilities.

#### 5.1.1 Access Control Security

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- **Buyer Role**: Can create trades, confirm delivery, raise disputes
- **Seller Role**: Can submit documents, mark shipped, raise disputes
- **Verifier Role**: Can verify documents, resolve disputes
- **Public Functions**: Limited to view functions and withdrawals

**Modifier-Based Security:**
```solidity
modifier onlyBuyer(uint256 tradeId) {
    require(msg.sender == trades[tradeId].buyer, "Only buyer allowed");
    _;
}
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Prevents unauthorized function calls
- Ensures role separation
- Provides clear audit trails
- Reduces attack surface

#### 5.1.2 Reentrancy Protection

**Withdrawal Pattern Implementation:**
```solidity
function withdraw() external {
    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
    
    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;  // State change first
    
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

**Protection Mechanisms:**
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: State changes before external calls
- **Balance Reset**: Prevents recursive withdrawal attempts
- **Pull Payment Model**: Recipients initiate withdrawals
- **Atomic Operations**: Single transaction fund transfers

#### 5.1.3 Input Validation

**Comprehensive Parameter Validation:**
```solidity
require(msg.value > 0, "Must send payment");
require(seller != address(0), "Invalid seller address");
require(verifier != address(0), "Invalid verifier address");
require(seller != msg.sender, "Buyer and seller cannot be the same");
```

**Validation Categories:**
- **Address Validation**: Non-zero addresses, role separation
- **Value Validation**: Non-zero payments, sufficient balances
- **State Validation**: Correct contract states for operations
- **Hash Validation**: Non-empty document hashes

#### 5.1.4 State Management Security

**Finite State Machine Protection:**
- **State Transition Validation**: Only valid state changes allowed
- **Atomic State Updates**: State changes in single transactions
